# Ninja Jump Game 

<img src="assets/images/responsive.png">

The Ninja Jump game is for anyone to play to pass the time. It's a very simple game where the user has to keep jumping over the Sumo Wrestler to try and get the highest score possible. If the Sumo Wrestler hits the Ninja the game is over and the user has the option to start the game again to try and beat their score.

# About

The Game does not have navigation and is very simple, it's just a one page website. The page has the game area, with the simple game instructions at the top and the score to the side. The game area shows a Japanese cartoon background with a Ninja and a Sumo Wrestler. The game is started by pressing the space bar key as indicated in the instructions. Once this is done the score will start to go up and the Wrestler will move towards the Ninja. The Ninja can be operated by pressing the arrow up key to make him jump. The longer the ninja can keep jumping over the sumo wrestler the higher the score will be. The Sumo Wrestler keeps trying to hit the Ninja continually. If the Sumo Wrestler hits the Ninja the game is over and the score stops. Game Over appears on the screen and the player can take a note of their score before pressing the space key to try again.

# UX

## Design
The site is designed with one page - The game screen. There are no navigation links.
  
## Wireframes
  Below is the wireframe that I created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
