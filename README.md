# Ninja Jump Game 
------------------------------------------------
## The Ninja Jump game is for anyone to play to pass the time. It's a very simple game where the user has to keep jumping over the Sumo Wrestler to try and get the highest score possible. If the Sumo Wrestler hits the Ninja the game is over and the user has the option to start the game again to try and beat their score.

# Features

## The Game screen has the title of the game, the game area and the score at the bottom. The game area shows a Japanese cartoon background with a Ninja and a Sumo Wrestler. The Ninja can be operated by using any key on the type pad to make him jump. The Sumo Wrestler keeps trying to hit the Ninja continually. If the Sumo Wrestler hits the Ninja the game is over and the score stops. An alert box will pop up to inform the user that the game is over and enable them to try the game again.
